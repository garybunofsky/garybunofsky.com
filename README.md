#GaryBunofsky.com
This is <a href="http://garybunofsky.com">my website</a>. A medley of files that are adjusted to improve performance, structure and, most of all, functionality.

##What is this repo for?
This repository exists mostly for me. I put my code on GitHub for many reasons, which help me sleep well at night. I have open-sourced this site so that you can examine how it functions.
