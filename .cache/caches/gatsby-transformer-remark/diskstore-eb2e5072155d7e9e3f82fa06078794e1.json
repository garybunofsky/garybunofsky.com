Say we want to get the full address of a user’s company.\nIt would look something like this: <code class=\"language-text\">user.company.full_address</code></p>\n<p>But what if not all users have a company? The <code class=\"language-text\">user.company</code> would be <code class=\"language-text\">nil</code>. And\nthen we would be trying to access the method <code class=\"language-text\">full_address</code> on <code class=\"language-text\">nil</code>. Ultimately\nwe would be left with the following error: <code class=\"language-text\">Undefined method &#39;full_address&#39;\nfor nil:NilClass</code></p>\n<p>We can use a safe navigation operator to prevent this error. We would write\n<code class=\"language-text\">user.company&amp;.full_address</code>. This would allow us to get the <code class=\"language-text\">full_address</code>,\nonly if the <code class=\"language-text\">user.company</code> was not <code class=\"language-text\">nil</code>.</p>"}
