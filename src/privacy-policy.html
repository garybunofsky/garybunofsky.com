          <h2 class="text--md">Terms and responsibilities.</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text--sm">This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their &#8216;Personally Identifiable Information&#8217; (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read the privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with my website.</p>
        <h3 class="text--md text--bold">What personal information is collected from visitors of the website?</h3>
        <p class="text--sm">When submitting information on the website, you may be asked to enter your name, email address, mailing address, phone number and/or other details to help you with your site visiting experience.</p>
        <h3 class="text--md text--bold">When is information collected?</h3>
        <p class="text--sm">Information is collected when you subscribe to a newsletter, respond to a survey, fill out a form or enter information on the website.</p>
        <h3 class="text--md text--bold">How is information used?</h3>
        <p class="text--sm">Information may be used when you submit a form, respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf the website or use other site features to:</p>
        <ul class="text--sm">
        	<li class="check">Personalize user&#8217;s experience to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested</li>
        	<li class="check">Improve the website in order to better serve you.</li>
        	<li class="check">Administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature.</li>
        	<li class="check">Send periodic emails regarding events and services.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="text--md text--bold">How do I protect visitor information?</h3>
        <p class="text--sm">The website is scanned on a regular basis for security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to the site as safe as possible. Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. I implement a variety of security measures enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information. All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on the servers.</p>
        <h3 class="text--md text--bold">Third-Party links</h3>
        <p class="text--sm">Occasionally, at my discretion, I may include or offer third party products or services on the website (on the Directory, newsletter and other locations). These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. I therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, I seek to protect the integrity of the site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>
        <h3 class="text--md text--bold">Fair Information Practices</h3>
        <p class="text--sm">The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
        <p class="text--sm">In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices I will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>
        <ul class="text--sm">
        	<li class="check">Notify the users via email</li>
        	<li class="check">Notify the users via in site notification</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text--sm">I also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
