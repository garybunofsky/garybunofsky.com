			<h1>My name is Gary Bunofsky.</h1>
			<p>I'm a designer &amp; developer in Cleveland. I build websites and emails. I design logos and identities for organizations. I also create print and marketing material. I do many different things, but the purpose is always the same: to help businesses reinforce their presence in the minds of customers.<p>
