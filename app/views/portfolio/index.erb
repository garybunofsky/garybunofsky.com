  <h2>Veronica</h2>
	<p>Veronica is a simple chatbot. She doesn't have much of a personality at the moment. If you text her you'll see what I mean. I'll be adding more features/commands soon. <%= link_to "Add her to your contacts", "/veronica.vcf", :target => "_blank" %>, text her (321)-233-9118 or <%= link_to "view the source", "https://github.com/garybunofsky/veronica", :target => "_blank" %>.</p>

  <h2>Pass.js</h2>
  <p>I wrote <%= link_to "Pass.js", "http://garybunofsky.github.io/pass.js", :target => "_blank" %> to help analyze conversion funnels. Pass captures URL parameters such as utm_source through hidden form fields. It’s very small and easy to install. <%= link_to "Visit the webite", "http://garybunofsky.github.io/pass.js/", :target => "_blank" %> or <%= link_to "view the source", "https://github.com/garybunofsky/pass.js", :target => "_blank" %>.</p>

  <h2>West Side Market</h2>
  <p>Cleveland’s historic marketplace is home to some of the finest food in the area. If you’re like me you have trouble remembering when it is open. To help with this reoccurring inconvenience I built a site to reference. <%= link_to "Visit the website", "http://iswestsidemarketopen.com/", :target => "_blank" %>.</p>
