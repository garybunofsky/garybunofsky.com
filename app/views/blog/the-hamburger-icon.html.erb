<p>Traditionally, global navigation is applied to every page of a website. Recently, sites have begun to house drop-down menu often to as a hamburger icon. <span id="more-30"></span>This minimized menu is often displayed as a button with three lines stacked horizontally, referred to by some as a hamburger icon.  The unique benefits to each navigational approach will be further explained.</p>
<p>With traditional global navigation, all top-level pages are viewable and clickable upon load â€” regardless of the visitor&#8217;s current location. Showing top-level links allows the user to gather information, which helps them discover what the site is about. Navigation presented in this manner also provides an obvious affordance. Visitors know that category pages are able to be clicked and will do so to proceed to the desired location. This is a substantial advantage since categories can be scanned with no added expense. </p>
<p>Traditional navigation only calls for one click to reach another top-level page. The hamburger icon requires at least two clicks, one to open the drop-down and one to select the desired category. In turn this doubles the amount of effort. This ultimately increases resistance since users are required to perform an action in order to simply view the site&#8217;s categories. One click can be the difference between a bounce and a conversion. While global navigation can be cumbersome to design and maintain, it holds these key advantages over minimized drop-down navigation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the desire to put navigation in a drop-down menu is understandable for many reasons. With a hamburger button, adding top-level categories requires no unoccupied space since the page is simply nested in the drop-down. Thus, it allows for more flexibility for future growth and adjustments. Furthermore, the website is not covered with a menu bar, which makes consistent styling much simplier. The hamburger button ultimately saves space, which is a hot commodity, especially on mobile and tablet. Minimized global navigation is an easier solution to the alternative, especially if similar styling across various devices is desired. It&#8217;s implementation undoubtedly makes the design process less complex since the need to store links in a single row is eliminated.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>There are obvious advantages and disadvantages to drop-down navigation. Most sites will be better off displaying top-level categories immediately. As they say, what is out of sight is out of mind. Options placed behind a button will ultimately be used much less. Thus, hiding features off-screen could be a poor design choice. Naturally, there are exceptions to every rule. In some cases, the flexibility of a drop-down menu may outweigh the possible risk of alienating users. Approaching this design pattern with goals and performance measurements in mind will allow you to decide if the drop-down menu benefits both users and your business.</p>
