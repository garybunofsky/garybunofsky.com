The <code>user.company</code> would be <code>nil</code>. And\nthen we would be trying to access the method <code>full_address</code> on <code>nil</code>. Ultimately\nwe would be left with the following error: <code>Undefined method 'full_address' for nil:NilClass</code></p>\n<p>We can use a safe navigation operator to prevent this error. We would write\n<code>user.company&#x26;.full_address</code>. This would allow us to get the <code>full_address</code>,\nonly if the <code>user.company</code> was not <code>nil</code>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 09, 2018","path":"/blog/ruby-safe-navigation-operator","title":"Ruby Safe Navigation Operator"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
